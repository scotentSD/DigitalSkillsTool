          IT course 2020 - Outline
      </h1>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Purpose</h2>      
    <p>The purpose of this course is to improve refugees’ IT skills and to enhance their independency. Also, it could be a crucial tool to tackle digital isolation.</p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Digital isolation: The vulnerable people left behind</h3>
    <p style="color: #B30000;"><strong>There is about 1 in 7 people in Scotland who can’t get online (that’s about 800,000 people)</strong></p>
    <p><em>"Digital isolation is when people find themselves in a position where they can't access the internet or digital media and devices as much as other people", explains Bibi Reisdorf, an assistant professor in communication studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
    <br><br>
    "In theory, everyone can access the internet, maybe at a library, community centre or at a friend's house, but there are different levels of access."
    <br><br>
    "Digital isolation is "surprisingly prevalent", according to Dr Reisdorf, with western countries seeing a rise in "mobile dependence". That doesn't mean people who are addicted to their mobile phones, it's when your mobile is your only access to the internet.</em></p>
